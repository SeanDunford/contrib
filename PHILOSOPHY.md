`contrib` is not a task runner, or at least not in the same sense as projects like make, rake, and grunt. It does not provide a framework for creating complex software tasks through contrib configuration. Instead it is meant to automate processes, which may include multiple task runner commands, version control commands, file system commands, and more. In that sense it could be more accurately referred to as a process or command runner.
